### Goal

End the game with more rupees than your opponent. Earn more rupees than your opponent! 

The game takes place in a potion shop, in which two twin-sister witches are trying to prove they are the better potion brewer. They have set up a contest: make more rupees selling potions than your sister. However, the witch's hut in which they set up shop is quite small, so they must share the same workspace, and deal with the same client orders.

### Rules

Each player controls a witch, each witch has access to their own inventory of potion ingredients and a list of spells they have learnt. These spells can be used to turn a certain set of ingredients into another. Each client order is a list of ingredients required to brew a potion and earn some rupees.

The game is played over several rounds. Each player performs one action each turn, simultaneously.
