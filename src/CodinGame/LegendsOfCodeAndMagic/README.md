Challenge [link](https://www.codingame.com/contests/legends-of-code-and-magic-marathon).

### Goal

Protect your base from monster attacks and outlive your opponent.

### Rules

Both players controls a team of 3 heroes. The teams start out at opposite corners of the map, near their base. Throughout the game monsters will appear regularly on the edges of the map. If a monster reaches your base, it will deal
damage. If your base takes too much damage, you lose.

Thankfully, your heroes can kill monsters. The game is played on a rectangular map where the coordinate `X=0`, `Y=0` is the top-left pixel and `X=17630`, `Y=9000` is the bottom-right pixel.
