### Goal
This game is based on the board game Captain Sonar.
You pilot a submarine and you know that an enemy is present near you because you are listening to its radio frequency communication. You don't know exactly where it is but you can hear all its orders. You and your opponent have 6 hit points. When a player's hit points reach 0, the player loses.

### Rules

Submarines move on a map constituted of water and islands. They can only move on cells with water. They can share the same cell without colliding.

The map is 15 cells in width and 15 cells in height. Coordinates start at (0,0) which is the top left cell of the map. The map is split in 9 sectors, which contain 25 cells each (5x5 blocks of cells). The top left sector is 1. The bottom right sector is 9.

At the beginning of the game, you'll receive a map (15x15 cells) that indicates the position of islands. Islands are obstacles. You cannot move or fire through islands. Then, you will decide where you want to place your submarine by indicating a coordinate (x,y).
