This game is based on Deck Building. Each team will have its own deck of cards that will get bigger during the game.
Each team starts the game with 4 BONUS skill cards and 4 Technical Debt cards. Those cards will be their personal draw pile. And their personal discard pile will be reshuffled into the draw pile when it gets empty.
